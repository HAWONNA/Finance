Project Title: A Study on Black-Litterman-Based Portfolio Optimization Using NLP and Conv1D+LSTM

Summary: This project explores portfolio optimization based on the Black-Litterman model, with a specific focus on integrating market views derived from natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The model leverages a combination of Conv1D (Convolutional Neural Networks) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) architectures to enhance the incorporation of market sentiment and outlook into the traditional Black-Litterman framework.
